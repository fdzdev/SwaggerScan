# SwaggerScan
SwaggerScan is an automated API specification analyzer and testing tool built with Flask and SQLAlchemy. It allows users to upload Swagger/OpenAPI specification files (.json or .yaml), parse and extract all endpoints, and generate a UI to interactively or massively test these endpoints.
